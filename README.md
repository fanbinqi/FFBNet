## Installation
- Install [PyTorch 0.3.1](http://pytorch.org/) by selecting your environment on the website and running the appropriate command.
- Clone this repository. This repository is mainly based on[lzx1413/PytorchSSD](https://github.com/lzx1413/PytorchSSD), and a huge thank to him.

- Compile the nms and coco tools:
```Shell
./make.sh
```

## Datasets

### VOC Dataset
##### Download VOC2007 trainval & test

```Shell
# specify a directory for dataset to be downloaded into, else default is ~/data/
sh data/scripts/VOC2007.sh # <directory>
```

##### Download VOC2012 trainval

```Shell
# specify a directory for dataset to be downloaded into, else default is ~/data/
sh data/scripts/VOC2012.sh # <directory>
```

## Training
- First download the fc-reduced [VGG-16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) PyTorch base network weights at: [BaiduYun Driver](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1nzOgaL8mAPex8_HLU4mb8Q), password is `mu59`.
- MobileNet pre-trained basenet is ported from [MobileNet-Caffe](https://github.com/shicai/MobileNet-Caffe), which achieves slightly better accuracy rates than the original one reported in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861), weight file is available at: [BaiduYun Driver](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1LXq3p6IOoQ6YJMY0xhRkLQ), password is `f7oe`.

```Shell
# Put vgg16_reducedfc.pth, and mobilenet_1.pth in a new folder weights and 
python train_test_mob.py or python train_test_vgg.py
```
### Personal advice: when use Mobilenet v1 to train voc datasets, use a higher learning rate at the beginning, The convergence performance may be better.
